# Recursion Product Program

This project contains a simple Java program that asks the user to enter five integers and then calculates their product using a recursive method. The assignment demonstrates recursion, user input handling, and basic project organization in Java.

## Project Layout

```
recursion-product/
 └─ src/
    └─ main/
       └─ java/
          └─ com/example/recursion/RecursiveProduct.java
```

* `RecursiveProduct.java` is the only source file.
* The code is placed inside the package `com.example.recursion`.
* The directory tree follows the standard Java convention used by Maven/Gradle projects.

---

## How to Compile and Run

1. Open a terminal and move into the project’s `src/main/java` directory:

   ```bash
   cd recursion-product/src/main/java
   ```

2. Compile the program:

   ```bash
   javac com/example/recursion/RecursiveProduct.java
   ```

   This will create a `.class` file in the same directory tree.

3. Run the program:

   ```bash
   java com.example.recursion.RecursiveProduct
   ```

4. Enter five numbers when prompted. The program will display the product of those numbers.

## Example Run

```
Enter 5 integers:
Number 1: 2
Number 2: 3
Number 3: 4
Number 4: 5
Number 5: 6

The product of the 5 numbers is: 720
```

## Locating the Source File

* If you browse the repository on GitHub, navigate into:
  `src/main/java/com/example/recursion/`
* There you will see **RecursiveProduct.java**, which contains the entire program.
